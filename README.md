# My Data Science & Neovim Journey

This repository is my personal playground for experimenting with data science workflows, specifically focusing on how far I can push **Neovim** as a primary driver for analysis. I'm trying to move away from heavy IDEs and build a setup that feels fast, personalized, and keyboard-centric.

## The Neovim Experiment

I've been really inspired by the work done on [kickstart.nvim](https://github.com/nvim-lua/kickstart.nvim) by **TJ DeVries**. It's been a great starting point for understanding how to configure Neovim without getting overwhelmed. Big shoutout to that project for making the entry barrier much lower.

My goal is to see if I can replicate—and improve upon—the interactive experience I'm used to in tools like JupyterLab, but entirely within the terminal without any mouse usage.

## Roadmap & Ideas

Here is what I am planning to explore and configure:

- **Quarto & Otter**: I want to integrate **Quarto** for scientific publishing and **Otter** (or maybe `molten-nvim`) to get that code-cell execution feel directly in my buffer.
- **Obsidian Integration**: I'm also looking into connecting my notes with my coding workflow. I want to see if there's a seamless way to use **Obsidian** alongside Neovim, or perhaps use a Neovim plugin that mimics Obsidian's linking capabilities.
- **Python & R Setup**: Fine-tuning the LSP and completion experience for data science languages.

## Status

This is very much a work in progress. Expect broken configurations and half-baked scripts as I figure things out.
